Coursework for the Programming in Python Course at Stockton University Fall 2023

## Course Description

This course is an introductory programming course for solving problems using Python. Students will be exposed to data types, control structures, input/output, graphical user interfaces, and data access & exploration. Testing and debugging techniques are used to find and prevent errors from getting into the code. Assignments give hands-on experience in application development for web, games, and data analytics using an integrated development environment.

### Course Software
Students are recommended to use VSCode as their IDE for this course. VSCode is available for free at https://code.visualstudio.com/. Students are free to use any IDE they choose.
Students are required to install Python 3.11 or higher.

If you are using VSCode you can install Python by installing the Python extension by selecting the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code. Search for python. Select the Python extension from Microsoft. Click Install, then click Reload to reload VS Code. More information on installing Python with VSCode can be found here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites

Python can be installed using brew on Mac
    For more information on installing Python on Mac see https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/
Python can be installed using chocolatey on Windows
    For more information on installing Python on Windows see https://chocolatey.org/packages/python

It is recommended that students install a Python virtual environment. This will allow students to install packages locally for each project. This will prevent conflicts between projects. More information on Python virtual environments can be found here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

We will be using pyenv to manage our virtual environments
We will be using pip3 to install packages. More information on pip3 can be found here https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

### Github
Students are expected to utilize git and github for version control throughout the course. Students should create a github account and email the instructor their username. (Assignment 1)
The Github Student Developer Pack is available to students at https://education.github.com/pack
